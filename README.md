# Basic Discord Bot

This repo contains a basic Discord bot which greets new users with a personal message and also let people add roles to themselves.
For the easier use the 'discord.js' library is used.

*Note: This Code is somehow poorly written because of code duplication (and maybe general flaws with JavaScript as it isnÂ´t my strongest programming language). My main focus was to create a functioning bot for my own Discord Server*

### TODO

- [ ] !nice: On command - Bot joins voice channel, in wich the user who commanded, and plays a mp3-snippet.

- [ ] !music: On command - Bot joins the voice channel of the calling user and plays the requested song/playlist.
