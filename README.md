# Basic Discord Bot

This repo contains a basic Discord bot which greets new users with a personal message and also let people add roles to themselves.
For the easier use the 'discord.js' library is used.

*Note: This Code is somehow poorly written because of code duplication (and maybe general flaws with JavaScript as it isnÂ´t my strongest programming language). My main focus was to create a functioning bot for my own Discord Server.*
